        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a Business administration major at the University of California, Riverside. I have attended both the University of California, Riverside and took extra units at my local community college, Mt. San Jacinto College. I graduated in the top 40 of my class in highschool at San Jacinto High School in San Jacinto, California. I have worked since 16 years old and have worked ever since. I played highschool football my freshman and sophomore years of high school and decided to move into the workforce to have some money in my pocket. I am very goal-oriented and love challenges. I moved up to level 6 at In-N-Out Burger in less than a year and worked at the locations in Hemet, California and Moreno Valley, California. I then worked at a high-end furniture delivery service where I spent half of the week in the Bay Area. Since then I was offered a job at a door-to-door sales company where I was the top rookie in my office. I was then offered a management position where I now recruit and train new employees. I enjoy working at this job as it has been great for strengthening my good qualities and has assisted in getting rid of my bad qualities. I have also been a co-creator of a book club with the guys I work with where we read self improvement books and have meetings twice a week. These book clubs have helped me grow as an individual as well as strengthen my reading abilities. Through having these leadership roles I see others asking me for help with their own lives whether professional or personal. I have 4 siblings, me being the middle child. I was raised in San Jacinto, California where I gained many good characteristics as I was surrounded by individuals who did not have the same background and identity as me. This has helped me be able to see people for who they are rather than judging them with prejudices. I enjoy going to the gym almost everyday as it is a way I am able to push and challenge myself both physically and mentally. I am all about having a healthy lifestyle and encourage others around me to develop and strengthen their lifestyles as well. I love to train and help those around me as helping someone with their body is one of the best things you can do for someone. I also am constantly looking for reasons to be outdoors as nature is one of my favorite places to be. I enjoy going on hikes and playing sports whenever possible. Anything from basketball to football to tennis, etc. I am always excited and willing to take part in it. Overall I am a very driven individual who enjoys challenges and doing more than what I am asked. Anything that pushes me towards being the best me is what I am in for. I am always seeking the next best challenge and always give it my all in everything.<br><br>
